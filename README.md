# Kickstarter Challenge

## Project Overview
### Purpose
The excel analysis will explain how other campaigns fared taking their lunch date and their fund-raising goal into consideration. This analysis help to identify the campaigns that have the highest level of success based on the launch date and the funding goal. 
### Background
Louise’s play Fever had a fundraising goal of $ 2,885. The total amount pledged was $ 2485. The excel analysis will inform Louise how who she was competing with and how she can better place her campaign in terms of campaign date and fund-raising goal to achieve a successful outcome.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Overview
For Outcomes based on Launch date, a pivot table has been generated showing the successful, failed and cancelled campaigns. This data is them represented on a line chart. 
 
For Outcomes based on Goals, the fundraising campaigns were split into several categories based on their fund-raising goal. From there on, the numbers as well as the percentages of successful, failed and cancelled campaign were identified. 

### Challenges
When looking at the pivot table and the chart for Outcomes Based on Launch Date, the month-to-month success rate is difficult to compare as the grand total for each month is different. In order to compare the month-to-month relative successes rate, it would be beneficial to convert the data in the table for ‘Theater Outcomes by Launch Dates’ into percentages. 

## Results
### Two Conclusions about Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date
An analysis of ‘Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date’ leads to the following two conclusions
1. The following are the top months for starting a camping
* May 67% success rate
* Jun 64% success rate
* Feb and Jul 63% success rate
* ![Outcomes Based on Launch Date - Line Chart] (https://github.com/shayanafzal/Kickstarter_Challenge/blob/1a4b586d4b3f6cf72bc6639741c0c9e66f0e1875/Charts/Theater%20Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Launch%20Date%20-%20Line%20Chart.png)
2. December is the worse month to start a campaign as it has the highest failure rate at 47%

### One conclusion about Outcomes based on Goals
For this analysis we only have successful and failed campaigns. We do not have any campaigns that were cancelled. The blue line on the graph representing successful campaign indicates that campaigns that had a goal of $1000 of less were most successful. They had a success rate of 76%. The second most successful campaign were those with a goal between 1000 to 4999. The third most successful campaigns were those with  goal between 35000 to 44999. On the other end of the spectrum campaigns with a goal between 45000 and 49999 had a zero percent success rate. 

### Limitation of the data set
The total number of days a camping is fund raising differs from campaign to campaign. Some campaigns were active for a longer period of time than others. 
Secondly, the data set tells us what campaigns were cancelled, but we dot not know what lead to the cancellation. Makes up only a small percentage of campaigns, however, knowing this could help improve the analysis. 

### Recommendations for additional tables and graphs
1. When it comes to looking at successful data outcomes by launch date, it would be beneficial to have a chart that shows percentages of cancelled, failed and successful campaigns. 
The data set doesn’t have a column for the number of days that a campaign was active in raising funds. It would be beneficial to calculate the number of days that a campaign is active for using the start and the end of the campaign dates. This can then be used to determine if having a longer campaign factored into a campaign meeting its fund raising goal. 
2. When looking at Outcomes Based on Goal, It be beneficial to have a stacked columns start. It would help easily identify which month has the greatest successful campaigns percentage.
